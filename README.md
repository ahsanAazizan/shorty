# Shorty
URL Shortener with NodeJS. To run the project, make sure mongodb is installed and run the 'npm intall' command first, also create a .env file and declare a variable called DB_URL and PORT set it to whatever mongoDB url(i recommend using mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017) and port you want to use.


## Run command: 
```console
npm i
npm start
```

### install nodejs and npm :
